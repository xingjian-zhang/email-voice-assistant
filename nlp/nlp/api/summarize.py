    text = """Peter, application deadlines are rapidly approaching! If you're ready to apply, head to gradapply.rice.edu. Deadlines vary by program, so be sure to verify the deadlines that pertain to your application.
        Have lingering questions about grad school life or the application process? Join us Thursday, Nov. 18, to chat with our Graduate Student Ambassadors at one of our Coffee Chats - sign up for the time that works for you here!
        To help you decide your plan of action, we've listed some commonly asked questions below, and more are on our website. Not seeing your question? Let us know! Refer to your program of interest for additional application requirements.
        How can I take a campus tour?
        We're happy to share our virtual tour with you! Click on the image below to watch a video about Rice's beautiful, green campus, set in the heart of Houston. You can also virtually visit Rice at one of our upcoming Coffee Chats! Register here.
        Where should my official transcripts be sent?
        Send official transcripts directly to the program to which you intend to apply. You may also upload an unofficial transcript directly within your online application.
        How do I report my GRE or TOEFL scores?
        A reminder that this year the GRE is optional at Rice, excluding programs in the Jones School of Business, though many programs will suggest you submit scores. To officially report your scores, visit the ETS website to order score reports if you did not do so on your test day. The ETS institutional reporting code for Rice University is 6609. Please allow 2-4 weeks for scores to reach Rice.
        I sent my GRE/TOEFL scores, but the application system shows my scores as pending.
        If your scores are not yet showing in your application, you can check with ETS to make sure you sent the scores using the correct code. You can also contact the program you are applying to and make them aware of this. They can open your application and match the scores.
        How are letters of recommendation submitted?
        Letters can be submitted within the application itself using a valid email address for your recommenders. More on this here.
        My recommender didn't get the request. What do I do?
        Please note that it is possible that the email generated by our application system was filtered as spam. You can log back into the application and resend your letter of recommendation.
        Can I edit my application after I submit it?
        Some programs will permit important minor edits to your application; please contact them directly with requests."""
